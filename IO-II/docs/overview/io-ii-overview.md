# IO-II Overview

IO-II contains persona blueprint materials maintained primarily for reference and continuity.

## Purpose

- Preserve historical persona specification artifacts.
- Provide a standards-aligned documentation layer that points to those artifacts.
- Maintain parity scaffolding with IO-III where useful (docs/runtime/tests), without inflating scope.

## What IO-II is (in this repo)

- A reference persona blueprint layer.
- A stable source of prior spec decisions and prompt structures.

## What IO-II is not

- The active runtime implementation target (that is IO-III).
- A fully normalized, rewritten spec corpus (legacy is preserved as-is).

## Pointers

- Legacy artifacts: `IO-II/legacy/persona-blueprints/`
- Curated docs: `IO-II/docs/`
- Runtime parity scaffolding: `IO-II/runtime/`
- Tests scaffolding: `IO-II/tests/`
