# IO-II Governance

## Preservation rule

- Files under `IO-II/legacy/` are treated as preserved reference artifacts.
- Changes in `IO-II/legacy/` should be avoided unless:
  - fixing a factual error that blocks understanding, or
  - correcting a broken link/path, or
  - applying a purely mechanical formatting fix required for tooling.

## Where changes should go

- New or updated explanations go into `IO-II/docs/`.
- IO-II runtime/test parity scaffolding evolves under `IO-II/runtime/` and `IO-II/tests/` if needed.

## Relationship to IO-III

- IO-III is the active implementation target.
- IO-II is the continuity layer and reference baseline for persona decisions.
