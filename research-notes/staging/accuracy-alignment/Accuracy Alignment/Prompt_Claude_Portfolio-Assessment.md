## About Me
I am an interdisciplinary designer with a background in media and new media design. I have worked largely freelance making music videos, graphic design, web sites, exmplanation videos, interactive learning modules, events, art direction and internet marketing. Although many of these skills are in the creative and visual design fields, I have a very large skillset in these areas which can be positioned to showcase my versatility and register of competencies that are helpful in AI. My background also grants me a great deal of experience in project management, team leadership, and professional workflows. I do not have any high mathematics training and have only completed a foundational course in Python, although I curertnly take classes to bring my python skills to at least an intermediate level. I also have a growing toolbox of applications that I use: Obsidian, Zettlr, JupityrLab, VSCode, marimo
