## 5. Optimal Learning Path Sequence

### 🔹 **1. Complete the Vanderbilt Prompt Engineering Specialisation (ASAP)**
**Timeline: 7–14 days (realistic)**
Outcome: immediate job qualification bump + portfolio-ready projects

### 🔹 **2. Continue IBM Generative AI Engineering Certificate (High Value)**
**Focus on:**
* Course 2: “What is Generative AI?”
* Course 3: Large Language Models
* Course 4+: AI Workflow Engineering\
  These build toward *actual AI engineering* roles.

### 🔹 **3. Continue Python steadily but without pressure**
**Python is:**
* a medium-term investment
* not required for many AI Specialist roles
* crucial for long-term AI engineering
* but not urgent for “get a job soon”

**Python Takeaway**
Finish the Google course while job-hunting.
