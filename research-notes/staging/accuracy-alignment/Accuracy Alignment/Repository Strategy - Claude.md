## Repository Strategy

### 1. `prompt-engineering-specialization` (EXISTS)

**Purpose:** Your Vanderbilt coursework **Keep as:** Learning documentation **Status:** Keep updating as you complete courses

**What to do with it:**

* ✅ Keep it exactly as is
* ✅ Continue pushing coursework there
* ✅ Pin it (if you want to show learning process)
* ✅ Reference it FROM your portfolio

***

### 2. `ceven-knowles-portfolio` (NEW - Create Week 1)

**Purpose:** Main portfolio landing page **Function:** Navigation hub to all your work

**What it contains:**

* Portfolio README (landing page)
* ABOUT.md, SKILLS.md, CONTACT.md
* `projects/` directory with links to project repos
* `learning/` directory that **references** your coursework repos
* Resume PDFs
* Portfolio metadata

**Key insight:** This is the **table of contents**, not the content itself.

***

### 3. `io-persona-system` (NEW - Create Week 1)

**Purpose:** Standalone flagship project **Function:** Deep documentation of IO Persona

**Why separate:**

* Big enough to be its own repo
* People might want to fork/star just this
* Shows you can structure complex projects
* Makes it easy to share just this project

***

### 4. `prompt-optimization-toolkit` (NEW - Create Week 3-4)

**Purpose:** Python project #1 **Function:** Working tool with code

**Why separate:**

* Code projects should be standalone repos
* Easier for recruiters to clone and run
* Can have its own issues, contributions, etc.

***

### 5. `llm-workflow-designer` (NEW - Create Week 5-6)

**Purpose:** Python project #2 **Function:** Working tool with code

Same reasoning as above.

## The Strategy

**Think of it like this:**

Your GitHub Profile
│
├─ Profile README (overview of YOU)
│
├─ prompt-engineering-specialization (LEARNING - coursework)
│
├─ ceven-knowles-portfolio (NAVIGATION HUB)
│   ├─ Links to all projects
│   ├─ Links to learning repos
│   └─ Resume and contact
│
├─ io-persona-system (PROJECT - flagship)
│
├─ prompt-optimization-toolkit (PROJECT - python tool)
│
└─ llm-workflow-designer (PROJECT - python tool)
```

## What to Pin on Your Profile

**Recommended pins (6 slots):**

1. **ceven-knowles-portfolio** (navigation hub)
2. **io-persona-system** (flagship project)
3. **prompt-engineering-specialization** (shows learning)
4. **prompt-optimization-toolkit** (when built)
5. **llm-workflow-designer** (when built)
6. **(Open slot for future project or profile README)**

**Why this order:**

* Portfolio first (recruiters see this)
* Flagship project second (your differentiator)
* Learning third (shows growth mindset)
* Tools 4-5 (shows technical capability)

***

## Additional Clarity

### Should you create separate repos for other coursework?

**YES, eventually:**

* `python-automation` for Google IT Automation
* `ai-engineering` for IBM AI Engineering

**WHEN:**

* When you start those courses
* Same structure as your PE repo
* Reference them from portfolio

**WHY:**

* Keeps each learning path organized
* Shows systematic approach
* Easy to navigate for you AND recruiters

***

### What about the Prompt Pattern Library?

**Two options:**

**Option A:** New repo `prompt-engineering-patterns`

* Standalone library of reusable patterns
* Referenced from portfolio
* Referenced from coursework repo
* Can grow beyond coursework

**Option B:** Inside `prompt-engineering-specialization`

* As a subdirectory or branch
* Keep it tied to coursework

**My recommendation:** **Option A** (separate repo)

* More professional
* Easier to share/reference
* Can include patterns from ALL sources (courses + IO + experience)
* Becomes a standalone value add

***

## Revised Week 1 Checklist Addition

**Monday Dec 2, add this step:**

### Review Existing Repository

* Check `prompt-engineering-specialization` is clean and organized
* Update its README if needed (make it professional)
* Add badge showing course completion status
* Ensure commit history looks good
* **Leave it as-is for coursework**

### Repository Planning

* Confirm repository structure:

  * ✅ `prompt-engineering-specialization` (exists, keep separate)
  * 🆕 `ceven-knowles-portfolio` (create - navigation hub)
  * 🆕 `io-persona-system` (create - flagship)
  * 🆕 Profile README repo (create)
  * 🔜 Tool repos (create later)

## Your Question Answered

> "So I take it that I can still keep this one dedicated to my studies but implement relevant parts into the Portfolio repository - is that correct?"

**YES - Precisely!**

* ✅ Keep `prompt-engineering-specialization` for coursework
* ✅ Create `ceven-knowles-portfolio` as navigation hub
* ✅ Portfolio **references** (links to) coursework repo
* ✅ Portfolio also has `learning/` directory with **summaries** and **reflections**
* ✅ Any patterns/insights you extract become new repos or projects

**Think of it as:**

* Coursework repos = **Raw materials** (exercises, notes, learning)
* Portfolio repo = **Curated presentation** (what matters for jobs)
* Project repos = **Finished products** (tools, systems, case studies)
