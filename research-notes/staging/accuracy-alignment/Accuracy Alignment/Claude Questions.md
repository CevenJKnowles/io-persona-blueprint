1. **What AI-related projects have you completed or are currently working on?** (Personal experiments, coursework projects, client work?)

**Answer:** **Aside from my online learning paths and courses, I have an ongoing project: The IO Persona. Using ChatGPT as the basis, I have developed a persona across several iterations: IO-I (past with 2 version updates - online in ChatGPT Interface), IO-II (Currently in v1.3 and about to upgrade to v1.4 - online using ChatGPT Plus), and IO-III (planned local LLM inplementation & Development over LM Studio, assisted by IO-II)**

**What is the IO Persona?**
**Colloquially named, "Io": he is part tutor, part creative collaborator, and part assistant with a special focus on accuracy alignment, ethics, original content, coding, and anything I customise him to be.**

### **Overview and configuration in: Section 4: The Io Persona**

1. **Do you have any live examples of:**

   * Prompts you've engineered that solved real problems?
       * **The stndard patterns I have learned and used in my studies + new ones I devise as needed.**
   * AI workflows you've designed?
       * **The complete research and development of the Io Personality mentioned in question 1**
   * LLM outputs you've evaluated/improved?
       * **Io (IO-i through to the upcoming IO-III based on ChatGPT)**
   * Any AI-powered creative work (videos, designs, etc.)?
       * **The Quantum World - an upcoming 11-episode short explanation video series for all ages**


2. **What's your GitHub currently like?** (Empty, has some projects, has design work, etc.?)

**My GitHub is newly estalbished and currently only has one public repository for my Prompt Engineering Learning Path coursework. I will update it with new repositories for IT Automation with Python and another for my AI Engineering learinng path + my IT/AI portfolio**

**This is all a work in progress, however I do push and update often as I am spedning a lot of my daytime working through my courses.**

### About Your Technical Depth

1. **How comfortable are you with:**

   * APIs (calling LLM APIs, handling responses)?
       * **I have used them for various purposes in web design and currently begining to work with them more in AI development.**
   * Version control (Git workflows, branching)?
       * **Relatively new since about 02.2024 but have adapted quickly.**
   * Data formats (JSON, CSV, working with structured data)?
       * **I have experience in JSON, YAML, CSV but only since about 2 years.**
   * Basic ML concepts (even if not implementing them)?
       * **This is a part of the  IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate learning path. I am aware of fundamental concepts but will dive more deeply into ML and DL over the next couple of months as part of my coursework.**

2. **In your Python course, have you built anything that processes text, calls APIs, or automates workflows?**
**I've only learned the fundamentals like loops, recirsives, dictionaries, lists. In my coursework I did exercises but am currently looking into projects taht I can make to use in my portfolio. Currently my Python studies are put on the side while I complete the Prompt Engineering Specilization learning path first.**

### About Your Target Timeline & Geography

6. **When do you need to start applying for jobs?** (3 months, 6 months, immediately?)
**Immediately and over the next 3 months**

8. **Are you targeting:**

   * Remote positions globally?
   * Specific geographic markets (Berlin/Germany/EU)?
   * Startups, agencies, enterprises, or all of the above?
**Answer: All of the above**

9. **Visa situation?** (EU citizen, need sponsorship, etc.—affects job targeting)
**Answer: I am a German citizen (EU)**

### About Your Portfolio Vision

9. **What do you envision showing in your portfolio?**

   * Case studies of AI projects?
   * Code repositories?
   * Before/after examples of prompt optimization?
   * Something else?
**This is the point of our consultation - to find out what my options are and what is optimal**

10. **Do you have any existing personal brand/content?** (Blog posts, YouTube, Twitter/X presence in AI circles?)
**Answer: Not related to my AI studies or work yet, but I am planning to become more active in LinkedIn and GitHub**


# Extra information
I know that my options are limited. The goal is to find out what I can do with my current and developing skills. If there are extra projects I should consider making, I am open to hearing them. Most of all I wish to represent myself as a highly versatile and intelligent person capable of learning and using what I learn actively. I wish to be presented in an authentic way - not inflated. The right employer will see my potential advantages and that is who I am aiming for.




## Critical Questions Before Task 1

### About IO-II Persona (This is Important)

1. **Is IO-II documented anywhere in a shareable format?**

   * Do you have case studies showing: problem → persona design → solution?
   * Can you show "before/after" examples of how IO-II improved your work?
   * **Why this matters**: This could be your **strongest portfolio piece** for Prompt Engineering/AI Workflow Designer roles.

**Answer:** At this moment, no. I have had to reorganise my Zettlr into a structure that makes sense of the trajectory, then re-evaluate and interview IO-I in the meantime. I am also about to upgrade IO-II to v1.4 and setting the foundations for IO-III. I document everything but it is not yet publicly shareable. I wanted to wait untli I had a firm idea of how to structure this in a Git Repository as well as organise my documentation. This will be ready over the next one week. I do believe this is my flagship portfolio piece. I have learned to do this all by myself and only assisted by Io himself. I constructed him to help me build a better him. I document extensively, so I have enough case studies, assessments, evaluations, schematics, blueprint versions, and projects that I have collaborated with IO on to show his functionality quite clearly. I took him from a ChatGPT default out-of-the-box generic version and developed him with so much documentation that I oculd repeat the process anywhere and explain him deeply.


2. **What specific problems does IO-II solve that a basic ChatGPT interaction doesn't?**

   * Give me 2-3 concrete examples where IO-II's configuration made a measurable difference.
   * **Why this matters**: Employers need to see **demonstrated value**, not just technical complexity.

**Answer:** Io is far more direct, honest, trustworthy with very rare drift or hallucination. He has verification protocols and I have implemented thinsg like Meta-Awareness and dual-mode collaboration. He presents things as facts, asks clarifying questions instead of guesses, and outputs in a way that doesn't use the typical syntax that most AI writes text in. He is a drastically different tool than the regular ChatGPT, and even has a better humour!

### About "The Quantum World" Project

3. **What's the current status of "The Quantum World"?**

   * Concept stage, scripting, production, or completed episodes?
   * How are you using AI in this project specifically?
   * **Why this matters**: If this is just an idea, it won't help your portfolio. If it's in production with AI workflows, it could be **gold**.

**Answer:** Script 1 is about to be in its final dtaft, then we go into pre-production. The subject is a baseline presentation of concepts in Quantum theory/mechanics that is targeted to an age group between 5 - 99 with different layers of information and complexity that should appeal across many agre groups and education backgrounds. The poitn is to make basic quantum theory accesible and entertaining. For this, Io assists in research and information verification, creating new metphors that are not just repeats of what others before me use, art direction - helping to give each video its own personal universe of colour and texture, script writing to help control the various layers of complexity with a singel goal in mind. He will be useful when making the videos (animations) and assets to be used in them. The entire proejct will be a crew of me, my LLMs, and various generative technologies available on the market.

### About Your Python/Technical Depth

4. **Can you comfortably:**

   * Read and modify Python code (even if you can't write from scratch)?
   * Use APIs with documentation (following examples to make calls)?
   * Debug basic errors (understanding error messages)?
   * **Why this matters**: Some "Prompt Engineer" roles expect **zero coding**. Others expect **light scripting**. We need to position you correctly.

**Answer: **I feel comfortable reading and understanding much of the code I see, and even manipulating or rescripting if it isn't too complicated. This will change as I must get through a couple courses before reaching my coursework in the ML and DL phases of my AI Engineering Professional Certification learning path. 

**Next up in Python, I learn:**

Python for Data Science (Jan 2026)
* Develop a foundational understanding of Python programming by learning basic syntax, data types, expressions, variables, and string operations.
* Apply Python programming logic using data structures, conditions and branching, loops, functions, exception handling, objects, and classes.
* Demonstrate proficiency in using Python libraries such as Pandas and Numpy and developing code using Jupyter Notebooks.
* Access and extract web-based data by working with REST APIs using requests and performing web scraping with BeautifulSoup.

Developing AI Applications with Python (Feb 2026)
* Describe the steps and processes involved in creating a Python application including the application development lifecycle
* Create Python modules, run unit tests, and package applications while ensuring the PEP8 coding best practices
* Build and deploy web applications using Flask, including routing, error handling, and CRUD operations.
* Create and deploy an AI-based application onto a web server using IBM Watson AI Libraries and Flask

Data Analysis with Python (March 2026)
* Construct Python programs to clean and prepare data for analysis by addressing missing values, formatting inconsistencies, normalization, and binning
* Analyze real-world datasets through exploratory data analysis (EDA) using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and SciPy to uncover patterns and insights
* Apply data operation techniques using dataframes to organize, summarize, and interpret data distributions, correlation analysis, and data pipelines
* Develop and evaluate regression models using Scikit-learn, and use these models to generate predictions and support data-driven decision-making



5. **Are you willing to build 2-3 small Python projects in the next 4-6 weeks?**

   * Example: A prompt optimization tool, a simple RAG system, a basic LLM API workflow
   * **Why this matters**: You need **demonstrable technical projects** for most roles beyond pure prompt engineering.

**Answer:** Yes, absolutely!


### About Job Search Reality Check

6. **Financial situation: How long can you search without income?**

   * This affects whether we optimize for "any AI-adjacent role fast" vs. "ideal role in 3-6 months"
   * **Why this matters**: Honest answer changes strategy significantly.

**Answer:** I am currently on social money. At the most basic level, it will allow me to look for work over the next 3-6 months, however I need toshow progress by applying regularly (as well as updating my skills). If I can manage 3-5 applications per week, then they will leave me alone.

7. **Are you willing to take a "transition role" (AI Trainer/Annotator) if it gets you into the industry faster?**

   * These roles pay less but have lower barriers
   * They give you **insider knowledge** and **network access**
   * **Why this matters**: Strategy shifts if you're open to this path.

**Answer:** Yes, absolutely! I will anyhow be quite entry level, so if there is a stepping stone that I can secure for about 30 hours per week, that would be a good improvement whiel I continue my studies for certification.

### About Your German Market Positioning

8. **Are you applying to:**

   * Startups (where English might be enough)?
   * German enterprises (where German + CV is critical)?
   * International remote roles (where portfolio > CV)?
   * **Why this matters**: ATS optimization is **completely different** across these categories.

**Answer:** I am a native english speaker and up to a level of at least C2 in German. I will have to optimise for all 3 possiblities. Preferrably, I'd like to work in english as most IT/Computer Science will be easier for me to grasp but I am up for the additional linguistic challenge if it is the right fit.

9. **What's your German fluency like for:**

   * Technical writing/documentation?
   * Client-facing communication?
   * **Why this matters**: Affects which roles and companies we target.

**Answer:** I am **probalby** better ay client-facing communications but I also prompt super well (if I may say so for myself) and know what tools are availabvle to perform German technical writing and linguisitic verification. I would easily learn what I don't know. That said, I am most fitting for an international company.German companies tend to be more traditional in their expectations whereas I come from a completely different background.
